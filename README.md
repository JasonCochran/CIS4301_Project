# Flight Delay Predictor

Jonathan Osorio, Lucas Sanders, Nicholas Kroeger, Jason Cochran

A project for our CIS4301 Database Systems class. We built
a flight delay predictor that uses Dept. of Transportation
data to predict if your flight will be delayed or not.

Built primarily with PHP, HTML, and CSS.
